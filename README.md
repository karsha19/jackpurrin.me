# jackpurrin.me 🌐
**This is the offical repository for my [website](https://jackpurrin.me)**

## About 🤘
I made this website because I just wanted a personal space to put the stuffs I wanted and my friends wanted, that's why there are games on my site. 

## Feature Requests ✔
If you wish to add a game, a site, or anything else, visit the `Issues` tab in this github repository.
You can request games, other sites, a program you want me to make, or just really anything! Go ahead, request something!

## Blocked? 🚫
If my website is blocked, I have another website. You can head to [jackpurrin.rf.gd](https://jackpurrin.rf.gd). This is an ok alternative but it won't be updated as often. It will get updated to my main site evantually, or I can find a workaround to figure out how to link this repostitory to an unblocked domain of this site. But for now, it'll do.

## Need more info ❓
It's all on my website! You can also find contact links on my website if you need even more info!
